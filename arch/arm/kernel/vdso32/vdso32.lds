 * Helper macros to use CONFIG_ options in C/CPP expressions. Note that
 * these only work with boolean and tristate options.
 */
/*
 * Getting something that works in C and CPP for an arg that may or may
 * not be defined is tricky.  Here, if we have "#define CONFIG_BOOGER 1"
 * we match on the placeholder define, insert the "0," for arg1 and generate
 * the triplet (0, 1, 0).  Then the last step cherry picks the 2nd arg (a one).
 * When CONFIG_BOOGER is not defined, we generate a (... 1, 0) pair, and when
 * the last step cherry picks the 2nd arg, we get a zero.
 */
/*
 * IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FOO) evaluates to 1 if CONFIG_FOO is set to 'y' or 'm',
 * 0 otherwise.

 */
/*
 * IS_BUILTIN(CONFIG_FOO) evaluates to 1 if CONFIG_FOO is set to 'y', 0
 * otherwise. For boolean options, this is equivalent to
 * IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FOO).

/*
 * IS_MODULE(CONFIG_FOO) evaluates to 1 if CONFIG_FOO is set to 'm', 0

 * Similarly, _AT() will cast an expression with a type in C, but
